# Pimped Fish Theme: clearance

This is my enhanced fork of the clearance fish theme. It gives you a couple of
things that the original clearance theme does not:

- Current git tag (short format)
- Current timestamp on the right prompt

## What's the fuzz?

A minimalist [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) while decadent theme for people who use Git.

Gives you the whole line for your commands while also showing you important information just above:
- Virtual environment (if applicable)
- Working directory
- Git status

Adds a blank line before every new promt to keep everything clean and easy on your eyes.
